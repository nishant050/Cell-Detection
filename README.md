# Cell-Detection
Trying various methodology for Cell Detection

## Problem Definition

This project aimed to detect and analyze a specific insect cell line, SF21 cells, using only a small dataset of images from our laboratory

## Objectives: 
* Accurately localize individual cells in unseen SF21 images
* Determine the correlation between cell diameter and protein expression in infected vs non-infected states.

## Challenge
* Very limited size of dataset: 
   - Total Dataset Size: 48 images
   - Control Images: 16 Images
  - Infected Images: 32 images

Cells are almost round in nature, and we are attempting to accurately detect cells with minimum labelled dataset
